# Shamir's Secret Sharing Algorithm

This project implements a simplified version of Shamir's Secret Sharing algorithm using Node.js. The algorithm decodes polynomial points encoded in various bases and calculates the constant term (secret) of the polynomial using Lagrange interpolation.

## Overview

Shamir's Secret Sharing allows a secret to be distributed among participants, where a subset of these participants can reconstruct the secret. This project simplifies the problem to decoding points and computing the polynomial's constant term.
